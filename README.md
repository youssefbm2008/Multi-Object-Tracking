Optimization of Face Tracking Based on KCF
Aiming at the problem that the target can not be re-locked after the target face is lost due to the interference, an optimized tracking algorithm is proposed to track the human face in the video for a long time. Based on KCF (Kernel Correlation Filter) and Camshift (Continuously Adaptive Mean-Shift) algorithm, the "voting" module is ad the foreground area, Camshift tracking algorithm and KCF tracking algorithm, the algorithm of tracking failure is determineded. By comparingd. Re-lock automatically. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve stable tracking of the target, and automatically re-lock and continue to track the target with the track, to achieve the purpose of tracking the target for a long time.
