Optimization of Face Tracking Based on KCF

Aiming at the problem that the target can not be re-locked after the target face is lost due to the interference, an optimized tracking algorithm is proposed to track the human face in the video for a long time. Based on KCF (Kernel Correlation Filter).

The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve stable tracking of the target, and automatically re-lock and continue to track the target with the track, to achieve the purpose of tracking the target for a long time.
